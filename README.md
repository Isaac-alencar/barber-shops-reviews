This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server for next:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Second, you have to run the json-server command to live our fake back-end:  
**This will open our "API server" which you should run in a different terminal window than the serve for next**

```bash
npm run server
# or
yarn server
# or
pnpm server
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
